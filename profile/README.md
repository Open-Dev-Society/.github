# 📜 The Open Dev Society Manifesto

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls.  
Where tools are locked in subscriptions.  
Where information is twisted by bias.  
Where newcomers are told they're not "good enough" to contribute.

**We believe there's a better way.**

---

## 🌍 Our Belief

Technology should belong to everyone.  
Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible.  
Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.

---

## ✨ Our Mission

We exist to build free, open-source projects, educational resources, and community experiences that make a real difference—empowering everyone to learn, build, and grow together.

- **Tools** that professionals and students can use without barriers.
- **Knowledge platforms** where learning is free, forever.
- **Educational programs** where teaching happens without paywalls.
- **Communities** where every beginner is guided, not judged.
- **Events and experiences** that connect, inspire, and empower.
- **Resources** that run on trust, not profit.

---

## 🔑 Our Promise

- We will **never lock knowledge**.
- We will **never charge for access**.
- We will **never trade trust for money**.

Instead, we will run on **transparency, donations, and the strength of our community**.
