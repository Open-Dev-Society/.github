# 📜 The Open Dev Society Manifesto

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls.  
Where tools are locked in subscriptions.  
Where information is twisted by bias.  
Where newcomers are told they're not "good enough" to contribute.

**We believe there's a better way.**

---

## 🌍 Our Belief

Technology should belong to everyone.  
Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible.  
Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.

---

## ✨ Our Mission

We exist to build free, open-source projects, educational resources, and community experiences that make a real difference—empowering everyone to learn, build, and grow together.

- **Tools** that professionals and students can use without barriers.
- **Knowledge platforms** where learning is free, forever.
- **Educational programs** where teaching happens without paywalls.
- **Communities** where every beginner is guided, not judged.
- **Events and experiences** that connect, inspire, and empower.
- **Resources** that run on trust, not profit.

---

## 🔑 Our Promise

- We will **never lock knowledge**.
- We will **never charge for access**.
- We will **never trade trust for money**.

Instead, we will run on **transparency, donations, and the strength of our community**.

## 🤝 What Makes Us Different

**Open Dev Society is a platform, not a gatekeeper.**

When you contribute or donate a project to ODS:
- **You always retain full credit** as the creator and owner
- **Your work remains yours**—showcase it on your resume, portfolio, and LinkedIn
- **You keep decision-making power** as the lead maintainer (unless you choose otherwise)
- **We provide the ecosystem**—contributors, visibility, support, and community

We don't claim ownership. We amplify impact.  
We don't take credit. We help your ideas reach further.  
We don't lock you in. We open doors for collaboration.

**Your project. Your vision. Our community. Our support.**

## ❓ FAQ

### Can I showcase projects under ODS as my own work?
**Absolutely!** Projects you create or contribute to ODS remain yours. List them on your resume, portfolio, and LinkedIn—ODS exists to support your growth, not claim your achievements.

### What happens to my project if I transfer it to ODS?
You retain full credit as creator and can continue as lead maintainer. We provide community support, contributors, and visibility—you keep control over direction and decisions.

### Do I lose ownership rights?
No. ODS is a platform, not a company claiming IP. You always own your work and can showcase it as yours.

### Can I leave or take my project back?
Yes. If you ever want to move your project out of ODS, we'll support that decision. No lock-in, no penalties—just community support when you need it.
